# RISC-processor-8-bit-Aa
EE 789 Assignment 2: Design of a RISC-type, 6-stage pipeline processor in Aa (AHIR Algorithmic) language

## Given ISA
Can be found in ```ISA.txt```

## About the hierarchy of repo
 ```simple_processor_with_data_on_pipes Final codes``` contain the complete non-pipelined processor codes

 ```pipelined_processor_working``` has the pipelined implementation of the processor
 
 Refer to the report ```report assignment 2.pdf``` for simple processor's working
 
 Refer to the ```project 2 report-pipelined``` report for pipelined processor working
 
 ## Aa files and Testbench
 ```pipelined_processor_working/pipelined_processor/src/``` for pipelined processor
 
 ```simple_processor_uart_with_data_on_pipes Final codes/src/``` for simple processor
 
 ## Outcomes
 Successfully implemented both pipelined and non-pipelined processors in Aa for a given ISA and tested their complete working by checking for addition of two 100-bit numbers on Basys-3 board
